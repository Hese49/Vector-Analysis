The purpose of this set of examples is to learn both Vector Analysis and SymPy. As starting skills you need basic knowledge of Jupyter, Python, SymPy and Matplotlib.

An excellent resources of theory, examples and practice problems:

Paul Dawkins: https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/

Youtube Mr.P Solver: '2nd Year Calculus, But in PYTHON'

Youtube Dr. Trefor Bazett: Playlist Vector Calculus

Youtube Dr. Bevin Maultsby: Playlist Multivariable Calculus

The problems come from the resources above and from the book 'Theory and problems of Vector Analysis', Schaum's: 1959.
