The purpose of this set of examples is to learn both **Vector Analysis** and **SymPy**. As starting skills you need basic knowledge of Jupyter, Python, SymPy and Matplotlib.
An excellent resources of theory, examples and practice problems:
*  Paul Dawkins: https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/
*  Youtube Mr.P Solver: '2nd Year Calculus, But in PYTHON'
*  Youtube Dr. Trefor Bazett: Playlist Vector Calculus
*  Youtube Dr. Bevin Maultsby: Playlist Multivariable Calculus

The problems come from the resources above and from the book 'Theory and problems of Vector Analysis', Schaum's: 1959.

 **Vector  Basics** 
 
 *VecAnal_1.ipynb*:
 1. Angle between two vectors
 2. Perpendicularity
 3. Projection of a vector $\vec{A}$ on the vector $\vec{B}$
 4. Line through two given points
 5. Area of the  triangle
 6. Volume of the parallelepiped
 7. Equation of the plane
 8. Work done in moving an object along a vector by a force
 9. Rotating body, angular and linear velocity
10. Moment of a force

**2. Parametric curve**

*  VecAnal_2a.  Unit tangent of the curve 
*  VecAnal_2b.  Tangent, principal normal, binormal, curvature and torsion. 
*  VecAnal_2c.   TNB-FUNKTIO: Tangent, Normal, Binormal, Curvature, Radius of curvature, Torsion
*  VecAnal_2d.  MECHANICS: Tangential and normal components of acceleration
*  VecAnal_2e.  Parametric curve (trigonometric)
*  VecAnal_2f.  Unit tangent vector, unit normal vector, curvature, (matrix representation)
*  VecAnal_2g.  The angle between the velocity and acceleration
